## Quick Start

### Getting Service Center

The easiest way to get Service Center is to use one of the pre-built release binaries which are available for OSX, Linux, Windows, and Docker. Instructions for using these binaries are on the [GitHub releases page][github-release].

[github-release]: https://github.com/servicecomb/service-center/releases/

### Running Service Center

First, you need to run a etcd(version: 1.3.x) as a database service，and then modify the etcd IP and port in the Service Center configuration file (./conf/app.conf : manager_cluster).

```sh
./bin/start.sh
```
This will bring up Service Center listening on port 30100 for service communication.

## Documentation
